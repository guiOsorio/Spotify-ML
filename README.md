# Spotify-ML

## DATA GATHERING

Data for this project was gathered through Spotify's API. The Python library 'spotipy' was used to aid in this process.
The data from all the liked songs for 2 users was accumulated, resulting in a file with info for 2579 total songs.
The Python script used to obtain the data can be accesed on the 'GetData.ipynb' file.
The Python script used to merge the 2 resulting csv files (1 for each user) can be seen in the 'MergeDFs.ipynb' file. The resulting csv file is named 'spotify_initialdata.csv'.

## FURTHER STAGES ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT
